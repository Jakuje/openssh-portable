This is a fork of OpenSSH portable
===============================================================================

The master branch contains various fixes on the way to be accepted in
upstream. But there are other branches that are less likely to be accepted
any time soon, but I would like to keep track of them:

 * gssapi-authentication-indicators : Improve GSSAPI authentication to
   allow checking for authentication indicators (since Kerberos 1.14)
   Bug: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2696

 * jjelen-pkcs11 : Support for PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512)
   (Already in Fedora 28 and RHEL8)
   Bug: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2817

 * ssh-agent-pkcs11 : Transparently handle token reinsertion in ssh-agent
   Bug: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2890

 * kerberos-unique-ccache : Improve handling the kerberos credential
   caches when authenticating using kerberos/gssapi or forwarding
   credentials.
   (Aleady in Fedora and RHEL8)
   Bug: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2775

 * run-user : Store the temporary files in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR if available
   Bug: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2950

 * gssapi-keyex : GSSAPI Key Exchange mechanisms

See https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#8.2p1 for the release notes.

Please read https://www.openssh.com/report.html for bug reporting
instructions and note that we do not use Github for bug reporting or
patch/pull-request management.

This is the port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH[0] to Linux and other
Unices.

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's sample
implementation with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to
external libraries), all known security bugs fixed, new features
reintroduced and many other clean-ups.  OpenSSH has been created by
Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
and Dug Song. It has a homepage at https://www.openssh.com/

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, PAM
support, EGD/PRNGD support and replacements for OpenBSD library
functions that are (regrettably) absent from other unices. This port
has been best tested on AIX, Cygwin, HP-UX, Linux, MacOS/X,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenServer, Solaris and UnixWare.

This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication.

There is now several mailing lists for this port of OpenSSH. Please
refer to https://www.openssh.com/list.html for details on how to join.

Please send bug reports and patches to the mailing list
openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org. The list is open to posting by unsubscribed
users.  Code contribution are welcomed, but please follow the OpenBSD
style guidelines[1].

Please refer to the INSTALL document for information on dependencies and
how to install OpenSSH on your system.

Miscellania -

This version of OpenSSH is based upon code retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS
repository which in turn was based on the last free sample implementation
released by Tatu Ylonen.
